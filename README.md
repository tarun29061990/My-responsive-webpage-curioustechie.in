=======================================

This is my responsive webpage and it can be visited at tarun29061990.com
This is a result of my curiousness towards responsive design. I have used HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. Used CSS media queries, modernizr, google analytics, PHP script for sending mail and used libraries like respond.js for supporting responsiveness in internet explorer. It is a fully W3C compliant and has 94% page speed and 92% YSlow grade.
